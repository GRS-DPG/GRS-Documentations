# **02. PII Data Collection and Distribution Policy:**

## **2.1 Collection of Personal Identifiable (PI) Data:**

We collect personal information from end users and administrative officers at various times to provide our services. The process of collecting personal data (PI) is described below.

1. Complaint Registration: We collect the following information, which is not compulsory, from the complainant for grievance registration: name, mobile number, and email, date of birth, gender, educational qualification, professional qualification, NID number, country, and address. Complainants can also submit grievances anonymously without providing personal information.
1. Administrative User Registration: We collect the user's office ID and password for administrative user registration.
1. Grievance Submission: When submitting a complaint, we collect the following information, if available: mobile number, email, grievance submission office, subject of the grievance, description, and any relevant grievance-related document files.
## **2.2 Use of PI Data:**
1. Service Provision: Collecting personal information, such as name, mobile number, email, address, and other relevant details, is necessary to effectively provide the grievance redressed service. This information helps identify and contact the complainant, maintain accurate records, and facilitate the resolution process.
1. Authentication and Security: To prevent unauthorized access to the system and ensure account security, users, including administrative officers, may be required to provide personal information such as office ID, password, and other relevant authentication credentials.
1. Communication and Notification: Personal contact details like mobile numbers and email addresses are collected to facilitate communication between system administrators and complainants. This allows for updates on the grievance resolution process, acknowledgment of receipt, and any additional information related to the complaint.
1. Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Collecting personal information, including NID numbers or other identification details, may be necessary to comply with legal and regulatory requirements specific to the grievance redressed system. This ensures the system operates in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
1. Anonymous Submissions: Some grievance redressed systems allow users to submit complaints anonymously without providing personal information, thus maintaining privacy while still accessing the system's services.

It is essential for the privacy policy to outline the specific types of personal information collected, the purpose of collection, and how the information is stored, used, and protected. This helps users understand how their data will be handled and assures them that their privacy is respected within the system.

## **3.2 Use of PI Data:**

1. Anonymity: Non-PI data allows individuals to provide feedback, ratings, and suggestions without revealing their identity. This anonymity encourages users to express their honest opinions and share their experiences freely.
1. Service Improvement: Collecting feedback and suggestions is crucial for enhancing service quality. Non-PI data allows organizations to gather valuable insights, identify areas for improvement, and make necessary changes to increase user satisfaction.
