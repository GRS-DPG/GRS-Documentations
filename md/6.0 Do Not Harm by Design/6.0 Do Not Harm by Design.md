**Do No Harm by Design:**

The UI design is compatible and easily modifiable to ensure that any inclusion of a feature does not harm the overall design. Best practices for designing the interface include:

- Keeping the interface simple.
- Creating consistency and using common UI elements.
- Being purposeful in page layout.
- Strategically using color and texture.
- Using typography to create hierarchy and clarity.
- Ensuring the system communicates what's happening.
- Considering the defaults.

These practices contribute to an intuitive and user-friendly design, allowing for easy modification and feature inclusion without negatively impacting the overall user experience.
