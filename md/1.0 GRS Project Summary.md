Grievance Redress System (GRS) is recognized worldwide as one of the enabling factors for organizations to be efficient, effective, and people-oriented. A functional platform for receiving people’s complaints or grievances facilitates administrators to improve their service delivery systems, thereby improving governance in general.

In Bangladesh, some ministries/divisions, other government offices, and NGOs have their online grievance redress systems. However, it has been identified that these systems need to be integrated into a single and centralized GRS to produce better results. This integration is a significant task that requires considerable effort due to administrative and technical implications.

In response to the recommendation of the report by the Public Administration Reform Commission (PARC) in 2000, the Cabinet Division of the Government took the initiative to establish a central GRS platform, bringing together the existing redressed systems in the country for the first time. In 2007 (revised in 2008), the Government of Bangladesh (Gob) established a manual grievance redress system in all line ministries to reduce grievances and enhance service delivery in the public sector. In 2011, the Cabinet Division designed, developed, and tested a GRS software, an interactive web-based software, and portal, for all line ministries to implement grievance redressed and mitigate people’s complaints regarding end-to-end service delivery. Finally, in the 2014-15 financial year, the online GRS software was hosted on a server and made available at[ (](http://www.grs.gov.bd/)[**www.grs.gov.bd](http://www.grs.gov.bd/)**.)**

This system provides multiple access points for grievance submissions such as web-based, android, and iOS mobile systems, the project also enable citizens to access the grievance submission process through the national call center 333, Union Digital Center, Facebook, and WhatsApp. These access points ensure that citizens can conveniently lodge their grievances through various channels, leveraging the popularity and reach of digital platforms. By embracing these technologies and multiple access points, the GRS system improves citizen engagement, foster a sense of inclusivity, and enhance overall service delivery.

The Grievance Redressed Project in Bangladesh not only focuses on integrating existing grievance redress systems into a centralized platform but also emphasizes the use of technology to streamline the grievance redressed process and enhance citizen participation. Through the Grievance Redressed Project, Bangladesh aims to establish a robust and citizen-centric grievance redressed system that not only addresses individual grievances but also creates a culture of transparency, accountability, and responsiveness within the government. By empowering citizens and providing them with accessible platforms to voice their concerns, the project envisions a more inclusive and participatory society, contributing to sustainable development and improved public service delivery in the country.
