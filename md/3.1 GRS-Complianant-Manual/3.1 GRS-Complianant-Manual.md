1. # **What is the grievance redressed mechanism?**
The Grievance Redressed Mechanism (GRS) is a platform designed to ensure the quality of services provided by various government departments. It allows citizens of the People's Republic of Bangladesh to lodge complaints expressing their dissatisfaction or grievances regarding any service offered at offices covered by the GRS system. This system also includes keeping the complaining citizen informed about the progress or decisions made regarding their complaint and valuing their valuable opinions or suggestions on any matter. Government officials or employees can also report their grievances against any service through this system.

Within the Grievance Redressed Mechanism, citizens can file complaints related to the services they are entitled to as citizens, either by registering or anonymously while keeping their personal information confidential. However, please note that complaints related to religious matters, those pending in any court, right to information, departmental cases brought against government officials, or those subject to review or appeal under law or rules will not be accepted.

**Figure-3.1: Citizen Complaint Filing Form**

In the complaint submission form, select the concerned department and service, enter the date of service application, your name, subject of the complaint, description, and attach necessary files. Finally, click on the "Submit Complaint" button to send the complaint to the complaint resolution officer of that department. Before submission, you can preview and print the complaint. Once successfully sent, a receipt will be displayed with the tracking number of the complaint.

Note: Save the tracking number to track the progress and latest status of your complaint. The complaint handling time limit is **60 days**.

## **3.2 Complaints submitted anonymously**
If you want to file a complaint anonymously, click on the **"Complaint"** button on the homepage and select the **"Complaint as Anonymous"** option.

Select the concerned office and service, enter the date of service application, subject of the complaint, description, and attach necessary files. After clicking on the **"Submit Complaint"** button, a preview will be shown to confirm the complaint. You can print the preview before sending.

**Important:** When submitting an anonymous complaint, please note that you will not receive information about the grievance redressal officer or a tracking number. Therefore, you will be unable to track the progress and status of the complaint.


You will not be given any information about the Grievance Redressal Officer and will not be provided with a tracking number after filing a complaint. As a result, it will not be possible to know any information regarding the latest progress and status of the complaint.
